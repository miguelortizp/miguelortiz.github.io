## about me

During the 2024-2025 academic year, I'll be a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University, at the [Research Program in Development Economics](https://rpde.princeton.edu/). In the Fall of 2025, I'll become an Assistant Professor at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. I have PhD from UC Berkeley and a BA in Economics from Universidad de los Andes (Colombia).

My research interests are in political economy, development economics and behavioral economics.
